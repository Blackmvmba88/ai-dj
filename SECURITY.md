# Security Information

## Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software may flag the executables as false positives due to PyInstaller packaging. This is a well-documented issue with Python applications compiled using PyInstaller.

**Update:** Thanks to community feedback, I've become much more aware of how these false positives affect user experience. What seemed like a minor technical detail is actually a significant barrier for many users. Lesson learned!

## Why This Happens

- **PyInstaller bundles** the Python interpreter with compressed bytecode
- **Runtime unpacking behavior** can trigger heuristic detection algorithms
- **Unsigned executables** are often flagged as potentially unwanted applications
- **AI-based detection** sometimes mistakes legitimate patterns for malicious ones

## Known Issues

### Malwarebytes Browser Guard

- May block GitHub repository due to "risky pattern" heuristics
- **Status:** False positive reported and under review
- **Workaround:** Disable temporarily or use "Continue to site" option

### Windows Defender

- May quarantine executables on first run
- **Status:** Executables submitted to Microsoft for official security analysis
- **Workaround:** Restore from quarantine and add to exclusions

### Various AV Software

- Common false positives with PyInstaller applications
- **Industry-wide issue:** Even PyInstaller's own repository gets flagged by some antivirus software

## Verification Methods

✅ **All source code** is open and available for inspection on GitHub  
✅ **Microsoft Security Analysis** - Executables submitted for official review  
✅ **Malwarebytes Review** - False positive reported for database correction  
✅ **VirusTotal Scanning** - Latest builds achieve clean results  
✅ **Python Scripts** - You can run the source code directly without compilation  
✅ **Build Scripts** - Provided for users who want to compile themselves

## If Your Antivirus Flags the Software

### Option 1: Whitelist the Application

Most antivirus software allows you to add exceptions:

1. Restore the file from quarantine (if quarantined)
2. Add the file or folder to your antivirus exclusions
3. This is safe to do as all source code is publicly auditable

### Option 2: Run Python Scripts Directly

If you prefer not to use the compiled executables:

```bash
# Install Python 3.10+ and dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server interface
python server_interface.py

# Run the installer
python installer.py
```

### Option 3: Build From Source

For maximum security confidence:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/innermost47/ai-dj.git
cd ai-dj

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build your own executables
pyinstaller --onefile server_interface.py
pyinstaller --onefile installer.py
```

## The PyInstaller False Positive Problem

This issue affects the entire Python ecosystem:

- **PyInstaller's own repository** gets flagged by Malwarebytes
- **Thousands of legitimate applications** face similar issues
- **Major projects** like Discord, Spotify have experienced false positives
- **Active GitHub issues** document this widespread problem
