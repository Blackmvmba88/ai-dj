# üéß DJ-IA VST: Real-Time AI Multi-Sampler Plugin

![DJ-IA VST Interface](./screenshot.png)

DJ-IA VST is a live music generation plugin that uses AI to create music loops in real-time directly in your DAW. The core innovation is the **LLM-driven prompt generation** that feeds **Stable Audio Open** to create contextually intelligent music that evolves with your session.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Proof of Concept** - Currently in active development

## üéØ Core Concept

1. **LLM Brain**: Analyzes your session and generates intelligent prompts
2. **Stable Audio Open**: Generates high-quality audio from these prompts
3. **Multi-Track Sampler**: Up to 8 independent tracks with individual MIDI triggering
4. **Time-Stretching**: Automatically syncs generated audio to your DAW tempo
5. **Live Performance**: Everything happens in real-time for live use

## üéπ Multi-Sampler Features

### **MIDI-Triggered Playback**

- **8 independent tracks** with individual MIDI note assignments (C4-B4 by default)
- **One-shot playback**: Samples play from start to end points, triggered by MIDI
- **Real-time sync**: Perfect timing with your DAW's transport
- **Individual outputs**: Route each track to separate DAW channels for mixing

### **Advanced Waveform Editor**

- **High-resolution waveform display** with professional visual quality
- **Zoom & scroll**: Ctrl+Wheel to zoom, Wheel to scroll horizontally
- **Precise loop points**: Drag start/end markers for exact sample sections
- **Live playback head**: Real-time position indicator with auto-follow
- **Smart locking**: Loop points lock automatically during playback

### **Intelligent Time-Stretching**

- **Host BPM Sync** (default): Auto-sync to DAW tempo
- **Manual BPM**: Set custom tempo per track
- **Off**: Play at original speed
- **Hybrid**: Combine host sync + manual offset

### **Per-Track Controls**

- **Volume & Pan**: Individual mixing controls
- **Mute & Solo**: Standard sampler functionality
- **Track naming**: Custom names for organization
- **Visual indicators**: Playing status, MIDI activity

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Plugin

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio 2019/2022** with C++ build tools
2. **CMake 3.15+**
3. **JUCE Framework**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE.git
   cd JUCE
   git checkout 7.0.12
   ```

### Build Steps

```bash
cd vst/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DJUCE_DIR="C:/path/to/JUCE" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Copy the built `DJ-IA.vst3` to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

### 1. Install AI Backend

```bash
python -m venv dj_ia_env
dj_ia_env\Scripts\activate

# Core dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install stable-audio-tools
pip install llama-cpp-python librosa soundfile pyrubberband
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### 2. Start AI Server

```bash
python main.py --model-path "C:\path\to\your\model.gguf" \
               --profile "techno_minimal" \
               --output-dir "./output" \
               --clean \
               --generation-duration 6.0 \
               --mode api \
               --host 0.0.0.0 \
               --audio-model stable-audio-open
```

### 3. Load Plugin in DAW

- Add DJ-IA VST to any track
- Configure server URL and API key in plugin
- Create multiple tracks with different MIDI notes
- Generate AI loops for each track
- Play tracks with MIDI keyboard/controller

## üéµ Multi-Sampler Workflow

### **1. Track Setup**

- Click **"+ Add Track"** to create new sampler tracks
- Assign unique MIDI notes to each track (C4, D4, E4, etc.)
- Name tracks for easy identification

### **2. AI Generation**

- Select a track and enter creative prompts
- Choose style, BPM, key, and preferred stems
- Click **"Generate"** to create AI audio for that track
- Repeat for each track to build your sample collection

### **3. Live Performance**

- Use MIDI keyboard/controller to trigger tracks
- Each note plays its assigned track as a one-shot sample
- Tracks automatically sync to your DAW's tempo
- Mix individual tracks using volume/pan controls

### **4. Waveform Editing**

- Click **"Wave"** button to open waveform editor
- Zoom in on interesting sections with Ctrl+Wheel
- Drag start/end markers to define playback region
- Right-click to lock/unlock editing during playback

## üéµ Why Stable Audio Open?

**Stable Audio Open** is the heart of DJ-IA because it:

- **Higher quality** than MusicGen for electronic music
- **Better stereo imaging** and spatial characteristics
- **More responsive** to detailed prompts from the LLM
- **44.1kHz native** output (vs 32kHz for MusicGen)
- **Faster generation** for live performance needs

The LLM creates sophisticated prompts like:

```
"Deep techno kick with sidechain compression, 126 BPM,
dark atmosphere, minimal hi-hats, rolling bassline"
```

## üéõÔ∏è DAW Integration

### **Multi-Output Setup**

- **Main Output**: Mixed audio from all playing tracks
- **Individual Outputs**: Track 1, Track 2, Track 3... for separate processing
- Route individual outputs to different DAW channels for advanced mixing

### **MIDI Control**

- Send MIDI notes to the plugin track
- Each note number triggers its assigned sampler track
- Works with any MIDI controller, keyboard, or sequenced notes
- Perfect for live performance and studio production

### **Session Management**

- **Save/Load Sessions**: Store complete multi-track setups
- **Preset System**: Save favorite prompts for quick access
- **Auto-Load**: Samples load automatically or wait for manual trigger

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **CUDA required**: CPU generation too slow for live use
- **Character encoding**: Some special characters may display incorrectly
- **Custom prompts not persistent**: Saved prompts reset on DAW restart (temporary limitation)
- **Audio crackling**: May occur with 2+ simultaneous tracks (increase DAW buffer size)
- **UI color updates**: Some button colors don't refresh immediately
- **Minor UI glitches**: Occasional display inconsistencies

## üéØ Live Performance Focus

DJ-IA is designed for **live performance**:

- Generate loops that fit your current musical context
- LLM understands what elements are needed next
- Multi-track sampler enables complex live arrangements
- Time-stretching keeps everything locked to tempo
- MIDI triggering provides precise performance control
- No complex effects - just pure AI generation + intelligent sampling

This is about **intelligent music creation**, not effects processing.
